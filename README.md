# DirectX Spinning Cube

This is a basic spinning cube demo written in DirectX using C++. You will need (at least) Microsoft
Visual Studio 2017, and the 'Desktop App Development with C++' and 'Windows 10 SDK' installed. Alongside
that, you will also need the [DirectX SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=6812),
and that should be it.
